Introduction
This project focuses on detecting vehicles in images and videos using Python. The main objective is to accurately identify and count the number of vehicles present in the given media. This can be useful in various applications such as traffic monitoring, congestion analysis, and automated toll systems.

Features
Vehicle detection in images and videos
Pre-trained model for quick setup
Customizable parameters for detection
Detailed results including bounding boxes and counts
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Shreelakshmivenkatachalam/detection.git
cd detection
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To detect vehicles in an image:

bash
Copy code
python detect_vehicles_image.py --input /path/to/your/image.jpg --output /path/to/save/output.jpg
To detect vehicles in a video:

bash
Copy code
python detect_vehicles_video.py --input /path/to/your/video.mp4 --output /path/to/save/output.mp4
Adjust detection parameters:
You can customize various parameters such as confidence threshold, model configuration, and more in the respective scripts.
Results
Example results of vehicle detection in images and videos can be found in the examples directory. These include detected vehicles with bounding boxes and counts.
